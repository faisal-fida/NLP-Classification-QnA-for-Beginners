# NLP Classification and QnA for Beginners

This project contains two Jupyter notebooks focused on natural language processing (NLP) tasks: text classification and text generation. The notebooks explore different techniques and models for handling these tasks, offering insights into common challenges and solutions.

## Project Structure

- **NLP Classification.ipynb**: Demonstrates text classification using a linear classifier.
- **NLP QnA.ipynb**: Focuses on text generation using a recurrent neural network (RNN).

## Complexities and Solutions

### Text Classification
- **Complexity**: Handling various text preprocessing steps, feature extraction, and model training.
- **Solution**: Utilizes `CountVectorizer` and `TfidfTransformer` for feature extraction and `SGDClassifier` for classification.
- **Challenge**: Achieving high accuracy on a small dataset.
- **Outcome**: Model accuracy is 25%, indicating room for improvement with more data and tuning.

### Text Generation
- **Complexity**: Preprocessing text data, creating a vocabulary, converting texts to sequences, and training an RNN model.
- **Solution**: Implements text preprocessing using regular expressions and word indexing, followed by sequence generation using a trained model.
- **Challenge**: Generating coherent and contextually relevant text.
- **Outcome**: The model generates text based on given prompts, demonstrating the fundamental process of text generation.

## How to Run the Project
